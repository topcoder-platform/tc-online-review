You may assign yourself to be the approver, or defer it to a copilot if you have one.  The approval phase gives you an opportunity to accept or reject the final deliverables.  If nothing is done at this point, the contest will automatically close when the approval phase ends.  If you need help, please contact <a href\="mailto\:support@topcoder.com?subject\=Need help with Approval phase.">TopCoder Support</a>.
