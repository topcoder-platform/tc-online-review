
 -- In listProjects.jsp file find the following text:

      <td class="lastRowTD" colspan="7"><!-- @ --></td>

    This is the definition of last row, that should appear as grey bar
    at the bottom of the last Category in the list of projects.  It does
    appear there as it should, but the problem is that it should appear
    ONLY for the last category, not at the bottom of every category in
    the list.  Verifying its apearrance with <c:if> tag won't be of much
    use, as the last category displayed on the page (for particular
    project type) might not be the last category spinned by the
    <c:forEach> tag.  Some clever method should be invented to address
    this.  Please note, that this bar should be visible for the last
    category in every project type list, not for the very last category
    on the page.

    The proper error information should be provided in case login information
    supplied by user was incorrect.  Such information should state that the
    user cannot login with the provided UserName & Password.
