This command line provides 2 functionalites:
 - run once (given a list of project ids or retrieve ids from AutoPilotSource)
 - poll mode (scheduled in background to run Auto Pilot every some intervals)

 The command line syntax is:
 java AutoPilotUtility [-config configFile] [-namespace ns [-autopilot apKey]]
	(-poll [interval] [-jobname jobname] | -project [Id[, ...]])

    - configFile specifies the path to config files to be loaded into
        configuration manager. if not specified it's assumed the config file
        is preloaded.

    - ns and apKey are optional, it's used to instantiate AutoPilotJob for
    	project mode. ns is also used to instantiate the Scheduler. The
    	default	values are AutoPilotJob's full name & AutoPilot's full name
    	respectively.

    - poll and project These next options are mutually exclusive (to indicate
        two kinds of run-mode): It is an error if both poll/projects are
        specified or none are specified.

    A) Poll-mode - poll is used to define the interval in seconds, if interval
        is not specified, a default of 60 seconds is used. The autopilot job will
        be executed every this interval starting from midnight.
        - jobname is the job name, Job Scheduling will use this job name. The
            default value is 'AutoPilotJob'. It is optional and can only be
            specified if poll is specified. It is an error to specify this
            option without specifying -poll.
        - ns is used to instantiate the Scheduler. Optional. The default value
        	is AutoPilotJob's full name.
        - apKey is ignored.

    B) - project can be specified to process projects with the given ids. The
        project ids will be processed once and the application terminates, it
        doesn't go into poll mode. If no ids are given, AutoPilotSource is
        used instead.
	   - ns and apKey, must be specified or not at the same time, default to
		   AutoPilotJob's full name and AutoPilot's full name respectively.
