BasicLog

<p>This is the basic implementation of the <tt>Log</tt> interface that
will write the logging message to the specified print stream</p>
<p><b>Changes for version 2.0</b>The following changes have been made:
<ol>
<li>Class inherits from AbstractLog now</li>
<li>Configuration 'stuff' was removed</li>
<li>Removed the prior static fields (no longer needed)</li>
<li>Basic log was changed to write to any type of PrintStream</li>
<li>Constructor changed to package private with additional arguments</li>
<li>Constructor calls super constructor to store name and then 
will store the passed print stream to an instance variable</li>
<li>The log method was changed to package private and it's method signature
changed to match the new abstract method from AbstractLog</li>
<li>The log method will first write the error message then print the stack
trace</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b>Implementation notes: </b>This Log implementation can be used
to print logging information to any PrintStream source (whether it be
a file, the console, whatever).  Please note that the level is always
ignored.  This class can only be created by the BasicLogFactory</p>
<p><b>Thread Safety: </b>This class is thread safe by having no mutable
state information.  However, the underlying PrintStream may or may not
be thread safe and is dependent upon what the application has specified
</p>

BasicLogFactory
<p>This is the implementation of the <tt>LogFactory</tt> interface that
will create BasicLog instances based on the print stream given</p>
<p><b>Changes for version 2.0</b>This is a new class</p>
<p><b>Implementation notes: </b>This LogFactory implementation will be
used by the application to produce Log(s) that will write the logging
information to a print stream.  This LogFactory implementation is used,
by default, in the LogManager or can be specified in the LogManager.configure
method.  The LogManager will then call the createLog method to create a 
log (in this case, a BasicLog) when a Log implementation is needed.</p>
<p><b>Thread Safety: </b>This class is thread safe by having no mutable
state information.</p>


Jdk14Log
<p>This is the implementation of the <tt>Log</tt> interface that
will write the logging messages to the specified java logging
system.</p>
<p><b>Changes for version 2.0</b>The following changes have been made:
<ol>
<li>Class inherits from AbstractLog now</li>
<li>Configuration 'stuff' was removed</li>
<li>Removed the currentLevel variable and it's usage</li>

whether an exception was passed or not</li>
<li>Overrides the message formatting method in abstract log to provide
an implementation specific version</li>
<li>Made the logger variable final</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b>Implementation notes: </b>This Log implementation can be used
to log information to the java logging system.  This class can only be 
created by the Jdk14LogFactory</p>
<p><b>Thread Safety: </b>This class is thread safe by having no mutable
state information.  However, the underlying java logger may or may not
be thread safe and is dependent upon what the application has specified
</p>

Jdk14LogFactory
<p>This is the implementation of the <tt>LogFactory</tt> interface that
will create Jdk14Log instances based on the java logger for the given name</p>
<p><b>Changes for version 2.0</b>This is a new class</p>
<p><b>Implementation notes: </b>This LogFactory implementation will be
used by the application to produce Log(s) that will write the logging
information to the java logging system.  This LogFactory implementation can be 
specified in the LogManager.configure method.  The LogManager will then call 
the createLog method to create a log (in this case, a Jdk14Log) when a 
Log implementation is needed.</p>
<p><b>Thread Safety: </b>This class is thread safe by having no mutable
state information.</p>

Log4jLog
<p>This is the implementation of the <tt>Log</tt> interface that
will write the logging messages to the specified log4j logging
system.</p>
<p><b>Changes for version 2.0</b>The following changes have been made:
<ol>
<li>Class inherits from AbstractLog now</li>
<li>Configuration 'stuff' was removed</li>
<li>Removed the currentLevel variable and it's usage</li>
<li>Removed the prior static fields (no longer needed)</li>
<li>Constructor changed to package private</li>
<li>Constructor calls super constructor to store name and was simplified</li>
<li>The log method was changed to package private and it's method signature
changed to match the new abstract method from AbstractLog</li>
<li>The log method calls the appropriate logging method based on 
whether an exception was passed or not</li>
<li>Overrides the log message object method in abstract log to provide
an implementation specific version if we are using log4j object formatting</li>
<li>Made the logger variable final</li>
<li>Fixed error in level mapping (finest/trace not mapped to trace)</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b>Implementation notes: </b>This Log implementation can be used
to log information to the java logging system.  This class can only be 
created by the Log4jLogFactory.  Log4j has the native ability to format the passed
message object via the log4j layout implementation.  A flag has been included 
to allow this Log implementation to use the log4j Layout rather than the
the object formatter component in this case.  Please note
that this flag only affects the log calls that do not explicitly specify
an object formatter to use (in which case, the explicit formatter will be
override this flag).</p>
<p><b>Thread Safety: </b>This class is thread safe by having no mutable
state information.  However, the underlying log4j logger may or may not
be thread safe and is dependent upon what the application has specified
</p>


LogException
<p>Exception class for all logging exceptions thrown from this API. It provides 
the ability to reference the underlying exception via the <tt>getCause</tt> 
method, inherited from BaseException. </p>
<p><b>Changes from v2.0: </b>As per forum, new loggers may throw this
exception so new constructors were added to allow unknown loggers to effectively
use this exception</p>
<p><b>Implementation notes: </b>This exception will be created by a LogFactory
implementation if it encounters an exception creating a log.  Currently, no
implementation throws this exception</p>
<p><b>Thread safety: </b>This exception is thread safe by having no mutable state</p>
Log4jLogFactory
<p>This is the implementation of the <tt>LogFactory</tt> interface that
will create Log4jLog instances based on the log4j logger for the given name</p>
<p><b>Changes for version 2.0</b>This is a new class</p>
<p><b>Implementation notes: </b>This LogFactory implementation will be
used by the application to produce Log(s) that will write the logging
information to the log4j logging system.  This LogFactory implementation can be 
specified in the LogManager.configure method.  The LogManager will then call 
the createLog method to create a log (in this case, a Log4jLog) when a 
Log implementation is needed.</p>
<p><b>Thread Safety: </b>This class is thread safe by having no mutable
state information.</p>


Level
<p>The Level class maintains the list of acceptable logging levels. 
It provides the user this easy access to predefined logging levels 
though the constants defined in this class.</p> 
<p><b>Changes from v2.0: </b>Added a convienence parsing method and made
the integer final</p>
<p><b>Implementation notes: </b>Extends the Enum class from the Typesafe Enumeration component 
to emulate an enumeration.  This class will be used directly by the application
when specifying a logging level</p>
<p><b>Thread Safety: </b>This enumeration is thread safe from being immutable</p>

LogFactory
<p>This interface defines the contract for implementations that will
produce Log instances.  The LogFactory will implement the createLog method
that takes the name to assing to the Log and return a Log instance for it.</p>
<p><b>Changes for v2.0: </b>This is a new interface</p>
<p><b>Implementation notes: </b>The implementations of this interface is
either created by the application or by the LogManager directly.  The LogManager
will then store the implementation in a field and call the createLog method when
a Log is needed,/p>
<p><b>Thread Safety: </b>Implementations of this interface should be thread safe</p>

Log
<p>The Log interface should be extended by classes that wish to provide a custom 
logging implementation. The various <tt>log</tt> method(s) are used to log a 
message using the underlying implementation, and the <tt>isEnabled</tt> method 
is used to determine if a specific logging level is currently being logged. This
class has various overridden methods to allow flexible logging. All log methods
will attempt to delay the formatting of the logging message to the latest possible
moment (which may be in the underlying logging mechanism if supported).  At the
highest level, the message will not be formatted if the logging level is not
enabled.  Beyond that level, it's entirely dependent upon the underlying logger.
Example: the java logger can delay message format processing until the last
possible moment natively and the log4j logger could delay message object formatting
until the last possible moment.</p>
<p><b>Changes to v2.0: </b>This interface was extended extensively to add in a 
number of new logging methods that deal with the object formatting or with 
string message formatting.</p>
<p><b>Implementation notes: </b>Implementations of this interface will be created
by the LogFactory and will be used by the application directly for logging
</p>
<p><b>Thread Safety: </b>Implementations of this interface should be thread safe
themselves but this interface does not attempt to guarentee the thread safety
of the underlying logging system.
</p>

AbstractLog
<p> This is an abstract implementation of the Log interface that can provide common services 
to Log implementations. This abstract base, currently, provides services to store and retrieve 
the name assigned to the logger and provides default implementations to the various log
methods in the Log interface.  This abstract base will be responsible for converting
the message into a string form and then calling an abstract method (that the subclass
will provide) to log the message.  Please note that subclasses may 
override any of these methods to provide specific functionality from the 
underlying implementation</p> 
<p><b>Changes to v2.0</b>This is a new abstract class</p>
<p><b>Implementation notes: </b> The developer should strongly recommend that 
future implementations of the Log interface inherit from this class to allow 
common services to be implemented more easily. Classes that inherit from this
abstract base will need to implement the protected log(level,throwable,message) method and
the isEnabled(level) (from Log).  The subclass will not need to check if the 
level is enabled in the log(level,throwable,message) method since that will be done
by the various methods in this class</p> 
<p><b>Thread safety: </b> This abstract class is thread safe by having immutable 
variables</p>

LogManager
<p>This is the main class for the Logging Wrapper component.  The Logging Wrapper 
component provides a standard logging API with a plugable back-end logging 
implementation. Utilization of the Logging Wrapper insures that components are 
not tied to a specific logging solution. More importantly, a change to the 
back-end logging solution does not require a code change to existing, tested 
components. Support exists for the console, log4j and java1.4 Logger as 
back-end logging implementations.  This class will default to the console
logger unless a new one is specified.  Additionally, logging a message object can
be generically formatted via the Object Formatter component prior to logging.</p>
<p><b>Changes for v2.0: </b>The following changes have been made:
<ol>
<li>The class was renamed to LogManager</li>
<li>The configuration manager was eliminated</li>
<li>CM associated fields and methods were eliminated</li>
<li>Support for a logging factory and object formatter were introduced</li>
<li>The console was made as the default logging implementation</li>
<li>The DEFAULT_NAME was changed to a public final constant</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b>Implementation notes: </b>
The LogManager will be used by the application to initially configure it (which 
includes not only specification of the underlying logging factory but also the
various formatters to use for message objects [if used]).  The application can
then use the LogManager to retrieve logging implementations throughout the application.
Please note that setLogFactory method should only be called once.  Calling it after Log 
implementations have been created will not affect the existing logging implementations 
(only any new ones produced).  Additionally formatters can be added after Log implementations
have been created (and those formatters will be available to the existing Log 
implementations), however - this is discouraged since the component assumes all
the configuration work as been done up front (see thread safety section).
</p>
<p><b>Thread Safety: </b>This class is reasonably thread safe.  This means that
the component is generally thread safe but relies on two things that can affect the
thread safety:
<ol>
<li>The underlying logger implementation may or may not be thread safe</li>
<li>It is assumed all the configuration (both log factory and formatting) will
be done before a Log implementation is created</li>
</ol>
Point 1 is in the hands of the application developer based on the logging system 
they choose.  Point 2 is more of a performance aid.  Since both the factory being
used and the formats of any objects to log are fairly static, to avoid synchornization
overhead - it will be assumed this is all done prior to usage
</p>
