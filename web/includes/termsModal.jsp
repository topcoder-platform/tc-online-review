                                            party or its agents or employees except by an instrument in
                                            writing expressly waiving such provision and signed by a duly
                                            authorized officer of the waiving party. If any provision of
                                            this Agreement is adjudged by any court of competent
                                            jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision
                                            shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary
                                            so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and
                                            effect. Neither party shall be liable to the other for any delay
                                            of failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement
                                            (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is
                                            due to events which are beyond the reasonable control of such
                                            party, including but not limited to any strike, blockade, war,
                                            act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, failure or
                                            diminishment of power or of telecommunications or data networks
                                            or services, or refusal of approval or a license by a government
                                            agency. This Agreement will be deemed to have been made in, and
                                            shall be construed pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware
                                            without regard to its conflicts of laws, provisions, or the
                                            United Nations Convention on International Sale of Goods. The
                                            jurisdiction and venue for actions related to this Agreement
                                            shall be the state and federal courts located in Wilmington
                                            County, Delaware and both parties hereby submit to the personal
                                            jurisdiction of such courts. Both parties hereby waive their
                                            right to a trial by jury. Any waivers or amendments shall be
                                            effective only if made in writing signed by a representative of
                                            the respective parties authorized to bind the parties. No
                                            provision of any purchase order or other business form
                                            (including but not limited to security access forms of any kind)
                                            employed by either party will supersede the terms and conditions
                                            of this Agreement, and any such document shall be for
                                            administrative purposes
